# Text-Summarization
This is a simple yet powerful Streamlit web application that performs extractive summarization on user-provided text using the TextRank algorithm from the sumy library. Extractive summarization works by selecting and presenting the most important sentences from the original text without altering the content or structure.
Step 1: Set up a Python environment
Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.

Step 2: Install required packages
You need to install the following Python packages:

streamlit (for the web app)
sumy (for text summarization)
nltk (for tokenization)

Step 3: Download NLTK resources
Your code already downloads the necessary NLTK data (punkt and punkt_tab) automatically on the first run. So no manual step needed here.

Step 4: Save your script
Save your provided Python code in a file, for example, app.py.

Step 5: Run the Streamlit app
Run this command in your terminal:

Step 6: Use the app
A browser window/tab will open automatically.
Enter or paste the text you want to summarize.
Select the number of summary sentences using the slider.
Click the Summarize button to generate the summary.
